== CGI Fast Escape/Unescape
----------

  The CGI Fast Escape library, by The Rubyists, LLC

This library replaces the CGI.escape and #unescape methods
with the versions from URLEscape, a C extension which increases the
efficiency of these methods at least 20x.

== Download

  Standard gem locations, source on github 

== Usage
-------

  require "cgi"
  require "cgi_fast_escape"
  CGI.escape("%03a" * 10000000)

Note: The above with CGI.escape may eat a lot of cycles.

== Tests

If you have the full source, run the specs with 'rake' in the
root of the library tree (lib/..).
